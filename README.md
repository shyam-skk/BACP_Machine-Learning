#  Target Response Prediction using ML Models
====================================================================================

MyBank conducted a personal lone campaign and they offer personal loans at 10% interest
rate. They targeted 20000 customers and collected and store the personal and banking
attributes of the customers including the target response. The data is stored in dataset named
PL_XSELL in CSV format. 2512 customers out of 20000 responded expressing their need for
Personal Loan; these customers are labelled as Target = 1 and remaining customers are labelled
as Target = 0. So bank need to create a machine learning model using this data set that can 
perform best possible target response prediction. So objective is to create a best fit model using
different machine learning techniques like ‘classification tree’, ‘random forest’ and ‘neural
network’ and compare and choose a best method and model for target response prediction.

a. Split data into Development (70%) and Hold-out (30%) Sample

b. Build Classification Tree using CART technique

c. Build Model using Random Forest technique

d. Build Model using Neural Network technique

e. Measure Model Performance on Development Sample for above each 3 models

f. Test Model Performance on Hold Out Sample using above 3 models

g. Ensure the models are not an over fit model

h. Compare the 3 Model’s Performance
